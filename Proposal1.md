## Description:  ##
TipZ is a web app that allows users to log and track tips and mileage more effectively. This website is aimed specifically at people who work in the service/catering industry who often miss out on tax deductions because of poorly tracked tips and/or mileage deductions. The website would also be a great tool for laborors/contractors who visit multiple job sites in  a fiscal year (Painters, Plumbers, Handymen, etc.). TipZ allows users to create a free account in order to track mileage and tips. These totals can then be pulled up and used on their tax returns to ensure users maximize deductions on their tax returns. There are a few mileage tracking applications and tip tracking applications, but our site incorporates both of them in one easy to use website.
